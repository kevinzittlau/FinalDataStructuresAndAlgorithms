# Final Data Structures and Algorithms Project

- Supply Chain utilizes the worldmap.txt to find a route that allows the maximum
  amount of supply with the start destination to the final destination 
  using recursion

- Pathfinding utilizes the path given as a string array in mainPath.cpp to find
  the best path from one coordinate location to another utilizes A* algorithm.
  The pathfinding also takes into account bombs and gold represented by 'b' and
  'g' respectively.
